# 0x03. Log Parsing

## Overview

This project entails creating a script in Python for log parsing. The script reads from standard input (stdin) line by line, parses log entries, and computes metrics based on the processed data. It involves handling data streams, parsing log entries, and computing metrics such as total file size and number of lines by status code.

## Algorithm

- Language: Python


## Concepts Needed

- [File I/O in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html)
- [Signal Handling in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html)
- Data Processing
- [Regular Expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)
- [Dictionaries in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)
- [Exception Handling](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3
- Files end with a newline
- First line of all files: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Mandatory `README.md` at the root of the project folder
- Code follows PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All files must be executable

### Tasks

- Log Parsing Script: Write a script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics based on specific input format. Print statistics after every 10 lines or a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C).
