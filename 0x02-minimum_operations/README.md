## Description

This project aims to calculate the minimum number of operations required to achieve a specific number of characters in a text file, given that the text editor can only execute two operations: Copy All and Paste.

## Project Details

- **Specialization**: Short Specializations
- **Author**: Carrie Ybay, Software Engineer at Holberton School
- **Weight**: 1

## Concepts Needed

- **Dynamic Programming**:
  - Familiarity with dynamic programming helps in breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution.
  - [Dynamic Programming (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/)
- **Prime Factorization**:
  - Understanding how to perform prime factorization is crucial since the problem can be reduced to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number n.
  - [Prime Factorization (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/comp-number-theory/v/prime-factorization)
- **Code Optimization**:
  - Knowing how to approach problems from an optimization perspective can be useful in finding the most efficient solution.
  - [How to Optimize Python Code](https://stackabuse.com/optimizing-python-code/)
- **Greedy Algorithms**:
  - The problem can also be approached with greedy algorithms, choosing the best option at each step.
  - [Greedy Algorithms (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms/)
- **Basic Python Programming**:
  - Proficiency in Python, including loops, conditionals, and functions, is necessary to implement the solution.
  - [Python Functions (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions)

By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be equipped to tackle the "Minimum Operations" problem effectively, applying both mathematical reasoning and programming skills to find the most efficient solution.

## Requirements

- **General**:
  - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
  - All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.4.3)
  - All your files should end with a new line
  - The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
  - Your code should be documented
  - Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
  - All your files must be executable

## Tasks

### 0. Minimum Operations

- **Mandatory**
- In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

    - **Prototype**: `def minOperations(n)`
    - **Returns**: An integer
    - If n is impossible to achieve, return 0
    - **Example**:
        ```python
        n = 9

        H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste => HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH

        Number of operations: 6
        ```
